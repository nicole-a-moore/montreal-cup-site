The Montréal Cup is a one-of-a-kind inline and quad roller skating competition held on Rue Ontario in Hochelaga. Since 2022, this unique 3-day long event has been organized from the ground up by a team of passionate skaters and local skate shops. 

<br>

During the event, a portion of Rue Ontario is transformed into a skate park that inline and quad roller skaters from around the world are invited to ride. Skaters of all skill levels, from beginners to professional athletes, travel to Montréal from far and wide to celebrate their sport by skating the park in a riveting competition. The event is free for the public to attend and always attracts a crowd. 

<br>

Not only does the Montreal Cup promote the practice of two re-emerging extreme sports, but it also is an event that builds community; it provides a safe space for groups that have previously been sidelined in extreme sports (women, LGBTQ+) to practice them, and it fosters moments that strengthen ties between individuals in the skating community. In previous years, thousands of people attended the event and many more viewed coverage of it via videos and photographs posted to social media.
